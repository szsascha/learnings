# leanings

I use this repo to share some of my experiences and learnings. Most of them probably came up when I was getting into something new.

I'll by far not share each new learning here and this is also not a "tutorial blog". Its just a kind of notebook where I share some of my upcoming notes with you.

Of couse you can create a PR if you want to participate and improve something.
